# modal-dispersion-and-cross-talk-
This is an implementation for calculation of dispersion and crosstalk
in large-core multimode fiber with and without mode dependent loss. In
this implimentation we uses different length of fiber, different core
diameter of fiber, and diferent couling regaime to plot frequency
response and crosstalk in the fiber Vs modulation bandwidth.  We uses
the fiber model described in "Principal modes in
graded-index multimode fiber in presence of spatial-and
polarization-mode coupling", Shemirani, Mahdieh B., et al. IEEE/OSA
Journal of Lightwave Technology 27.10 (2009): 1248-1261. Documentation
